-- Player-collision auras (90210-90213).
--
-- Four buffs that switch on client-side player-vs-player collision. They span
-- two independent axes - WHO is affected, and whether the blocking is one-way or
-- mutual:
--
--   90210 Obstruction   enemies cannot pass through you   (you still pass them)
--   90211 Immovable     nobody can pass through you       (you still pass them)
--   90212 Bodycheck     mutual collision with enemies
--   90213 Solid Form    mutual collision with everyone
--
-- The auras are completely INERT server-side: nothing reads them, no script is
-- bound, and the effect is SPELL_AURA_DUMMY. All of the behaviour lives in the
-- client tweak DLL (tools\animspeedfix\playercollide.cpp), which each frame
-- clips the local player's own movement delta against nearby players. It decides
-- who blocks whom purely by reading these aura ids off the units it can see:
--
--     blocked by X  =  X has Immovable
--                   or X has Obstruction    and we are hostile
--                   or (I or X) has Solid Form
--                   or (I or X) has Bodycheck  and we are hostile
--
-- Hostility uses the client's own reaction test (the same one behind the
-- UnitIsEnemy Lua API), so it matches nameplate colouring exactly.
--
-- Consequences worth knowing:
--   * A player whose client does not have the DLL will walk through everyone.
--     Collision is enforced by each client on ITSELF, so it is only as reliable
--     as client coverage. client-tweaks is a mandatory launcher patch today.
--   * Because each client clips only its own movement, the one-way auras
--     (90210/90211) work without the wearer's client doing anything at all.
--
-- Donor is 23451 Speed, the same clean single-effect APPLY_AURA row used for the
-- Recharge rune: Attributes 0 (nothing hides the buff icon) and one effect.
-- Everything meaningful is overwritten below; see the byte-clone pitfalls note in
-- the spell pipeline docs before swapping donors.
--
-- SpellVisualID is zeroed. The donor carries 6922 - Speed's pickup effect - and a
-- byte-clone inherits it, which would put a speed-boost graphic on every one of
-- these. They are meant to be invisible: the buff icon is the only feedback.
--
-- DurationIndex is taken from the donor (index 1 = 10s) and overridden to 21,
-- VERIFIED as Duration -1 (infinite) in dbc.spellduration_lplus - these are
-- mode-defining buffs, not timed pickups. Change it if they should expire.
--
-- Icon ids were verified to exist in dbc.spellicon_lplus. An id with no row there
-- renders as a blank/question-mark buff icon.
--
-- After applying: regenerate the binary Spell.dbc from this table with
-- tools\recolor\itemforge\spell_dbc.py (run --verify first, it must report 0
-- mismatches), deploy to ALL FOUR Spell.dbc homes (prod server, dev server,
-- itemforge/dbc, client patch), then repack the client patch. A table-only edit
-- is wiped by the next DB refresh.
--
-- Replayable: deletes its own ids before inserting.
